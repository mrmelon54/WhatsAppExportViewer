# WhatsApp Export Viewer

Rebuild of [WhatsApp Export Viewer Old](https://github.com/MrMelon54/WhatsAppExportViewer-Old) from the ground up.

## Install

Please download and install using the latest release

[Latest Release](https://github.com/MrMelon54/WhatsAppExportViewer/releases/latest)

## Development

Start with: `yarn start`

> Vite builds the renderer and watches for changes. Meanwhile, electron starts up and loads the index.html file built.

Build with `yarn build`

> Vite statically builds the renderer into `src/renderer/dist`, then electron-builder packages up the build into an executable.

Enjoy!
